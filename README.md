# sneakyBat

When the user runs the .bat file, the target's ip configuration is sent to your email and then sends a friendly message and (optionally) restarts their machine.
I would recommend to not download the zip file, as the formatting is very messy and difficult to read when you open it in notepad.
Instead, I would copy the code from the file, and then paste it in a notepad file, then saving it as a .bat file and giving it a realistic name that a target would run.
Be sure to first view the code before sending to target in order to set your email address, or if you wanted to make any changes or additions.
If you would like to change the email it sends from, change the variables "GmailAccount" and "GmailPassword", which contain the credentials of the email that sends the ip info file.
There is a comment in there ":: shutdown /r" that gives you the option to also shut down the machine; remove the comment ("::") to enable the command.
Tip: if playing as a prank, make sure that target would be fine if pc shuts down, as shutdown /r restarts their computer and may cause them to lose any unsaved work.
Have fun! :D
